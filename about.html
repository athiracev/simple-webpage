            <h2 style="color: rgba(20, 12, 177, 0.937);">The Great Wall Of China - China, Built In 220 BCE</h2>

            <p style="color: rgb(127, 30, 30);"><b><i>The Great Wall of China</i></b> is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, which were constructed across the northern border of China to protect the country from invasions by various nomadic and military incursions. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic symbols of China's ancient civilization.

                Construction of the Great Wall began much earlier than the date you mentioned. It was not built in 220 BCE but rather over several centuries. The earliest walls and fortifications were constructed as early as the 7th century BC during the Warring States period. The idea of connecting these separate walls and expanding the fortifications to create a continuous defensive barrier against northern invaders was carried out by the Qin Dynasty under the rule of Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor, around 220-206 BCE. This was part of a larger project that also involved standardizing measures like currency, writing, and weights.
                
                The construction and maintenance of the Great Wall continued through various dynasties, including the Han, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, with different rulers and periods of expansion and repair. Over time, the Great Wall stretched for thousands of miles, with various sections built and rebuilt to protect China's borders. Different parts of the wall are made of different materials, such as brick, stone, or tamped earth.
                
                The Great Wall of China is an impressive architectural feat and is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. It served not only as a defense system but also as a means of controlling trade and immigration, allowing for the imposition of tariffs on goods passing through gates along the wall. Today, many sections of the Great Wall are open to tourists, offering a glimpse into China's rich history and its commitment to safeguarding its territory.

            <h2 style="color: rgba(20, 12, 177, 0.937);" >Petra - Jordan, Built In 312 BCE</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(133, 83, 23);"><b><i>Petra</i></b> is an ancient archaeological city located in southern Jordan. Your date is approximately correct; while the city's history dates back even earlier, Petra reached its peak during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The city was established as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BCE, which is close to the year 312 BCE.

                The Nabataeans were a nomadic Arab people who settled in the area and developed Petra as a major trading hub. The city is known for its impressive rock-cut architecture, with buildings and tombs carved directly into the rose-red cliffs of the surrounding mountains. The most famous structure in Petra is Al-Khazneh, or "The Treasury," which is a stunning monument and a popular tourist attraction.
                
                During the Roman period, Petra continued to prosper as a trading center, and the city's architecture and influence expanded. After the decline of the Nabataean Kingdom and a series of earthquakes, Petra began to decline in importance. It was eventually abandoned and largely forgotten by the Western world until it was rediscovered in the early 19th century.
                
                In 1985, Petra was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is often referred to as the "Rose City" due to the color of the stone from which it is carved. It is a remarkable historical and archaeological site that offers insight into the ancient Nabataean culture and is a significant part of Jordan's cultural heritage.
